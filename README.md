# WAKEWORD OR HOTWORD DETECTION SYSTEM BUILT WITH PYTHON

Introduction:
This repository contains a Wake Word Detection System developed using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to accurately identify a specific "hotword" from a continuous audio stream. The project utilizes a confusion matrix to differentiate between the hotword and any other spoken words.

Features:

Wake Word Detection: The system employs machine learning algorithms to detect a specific wake word from an audio stream.
Continuous Audio Stream Processing: The system is capable of processing a continuous stream of audio, allowing for real-time wake word detection.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is utilized to analyze the performance of the wake word detection system. It helps in measuring the accuracy and reliability of the system in distinguishing the hotword from other spoken words.
Usage:
To use the wake word detection system, follow these steps:

Prepare the Training Data: Collect and label audio samples containing the hotword and other spoken words.
Train the Model: Utilize machine learning techniques to train the wake word detection model using the provided training data.
Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the system using the confusion matrix, which provides valuable insights into the system's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Integration: Integrate the trained model into your desired application or device for real-time wake word detection.
